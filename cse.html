Computer Science with specilization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. We also offer Ph.D. Programmes for full time and working professional mode in all areas where research is being currently conducted by our faculty members.</p>
                    
<p class="text-justify"> We have highly qualified, competent and experienced faculty which is supported by well-equipped labs and infrastructure. Our department carries a vision to groom our students into professionals in their respective area of expertise. To do so, besides curriculum, we expose our students to frequent high quality skill enhancement workshops, industry visits, expert lectures, national and international conferences. Our students have achieved very high ratio of placement in good companies and several of them progressed to pursue further education abroad. We do regular updates in our curriculum to address need of the hour in the industry and to make our students ready for cutting edge technology. Under the supervision of our esteemed faculty, several scholars have completed their Ph.D. with high quality research and several are still pursuing. Our students and scholars have explored very deep in latest area in the computer science and information technology. These areas include Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing,Image Processing, Cyber Security, Big Data, Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, Decision Making, Sensor Networks, Object-Oriented Programming, Component-Oriented Programming, Aspect-Oriented Programming, professional level Software Engineering, and many more.</p></li>

                    <p class="text-justify"> The field of Computer Science and Engineering has been pushing the envelope of almost all other disciplines, which use computing as a fundamental means of inquiry and tool for discovery. Computer Science and Engineering offers exciting, intellectually challenging, and rapidly growing career opportunities. It is the heart of where the action is: whether this means artificial intelligence applications, intelligent game playing, mobile applications, smart robots, cloud computing, data security, big data analytics, cyber security, and social networks. Teaching-Learning process is given at most priority in pursuit of improving the quality of technical education. Innovative teaching aids and methodologies are used by the department towards this goal. The efficacy of the Teaching-Learning process is reflected in the consistently excellent results being achieved every year. The department regularly organizes student development programme, short term training programme, conferences, seminars, webinars, workshops, expert lecturers, and expert lecture series for the students. Faculty development programs are organized for faculty to promote high standards in technical education. We, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, look forward to working with you to make your engagement with our department a successful and pleasant experience.</p>
