                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the most fascinating fields for understanding and practicing. Even tiny pieces of device nugget possess incredible magic. A mobile phone takes the electromagnetic signal from the
                        air, converts, compress and processes this information further and shove it again in the air. Jillions of these data in a very short span of time received these messages and sent reliably to the different corner of the globe.
                        Everybody in the universe is connected wirelessly through just one identity number. The students of the department are nurtured in such a way they can be well recruitable in repute companies or become researchers after completion of
                        their degree from the department. Further, I am confident that this bunch of professional talents, who are going to complete our studies from the department, will be of great value and a big asset to any organization they join.

                        I warmly welcome you to the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Gautam Buddha University. Over all these years, we have made progress in imparting technical education to our students and bring them at par with
                        the ever-expanding horizons of Electronics and Communication Engineering and its application areas.
                        At the under graduate level, we offer four-year B.Tech. Programme, and four-year B.Tech. (Engineering Design) Programme. At post graduate level, we offer three areas of specialization for two-year M.Tech. Programmes: (i) Wireless
                        Communication and Networks, (ii) VLSI Design (iii) Railway Signalling Telecommunication and RAMS. We also offer Ph.D. Programmes for full time and working professional mode in all areas where research is being currently conducted by
                        our faculty members.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The Electronics and Communication Engineering department has always placed prime emphasis on excellence in teaching and research. Faculty members have very good academic credentials, and are highly motivated towards imparting the
                        best of education, and also pioneering research and development. Our courses are frequently updated in terms of depth as well as the subjects themselves, so that our students always remain on the forefront of technological
                        advancement. Well-equipped Laboratories and encouragement to pursue research has increased our students’ productivity in terms of placements, higher studies and research contributions. It has been observed that student research
                        contribution has increased tremendously during last few years. We regularly organize seminars/workshops/conferences/faculty development programmes/skill enhancement programmes/expert talks/invited lectures etc. that benefits our
                        students
                        as well as the staff members of our school.
